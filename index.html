        <div class="col col-left">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> Back in the 1600s,  SOHO was farmland that had been used to some of the manumitted slaves of the Dutch West India Company.
            1794, the place that was near the junction of Broadway and Canal Street was attracting few manufacturing businesses.
            1880- Steel replaced cast iron as the material of choice for construction, freezing the neighborhood in time
            Pre 1959- the primary function of the neighborhood was as a center of industrial shops and warehouses i.e. seamstress shops. Immigrants (especially Irish) with large families and no place to stay would squat in the lofts until they were recognized and kicked out by NYPD
            1959- Artist Tenant Association established, Artists would be attracted to the neighborhood because of all the empty lots which made fantastic studios. They lived in their place of work which is illegal
            1965- SoHo becomes an official residential neighborhood when the Dept. of Sanitation introduced a trash pickup route through the area
            1969- Artists petitioned to prevent the construction of the Lower Manhattan Expressway (LOMEX) as it would tear through the Cast Iron District and Little Italy, asserting the area’s significance.

              <h2>The functionality of this neighborhood </h2>
              <p>
               During the pre-colonial period, SOHO was farmland used as a place where manumitted slaves were living and worked on agriculture to have a brighter future. However, their future was less secure than the rest of the other citizens. When 1794  came around, manufacturing businesses were beginning to take place near the junction of Broadway and canal street. For example, a wealthy merchant by the name of   Joseph Blackwell owned a cast iron foundry and sales shops on the island he founded and called it Blackwell’s Island, located northwest corner of the intersection. Another person named Thomas Duggan who was next to Blackwell’s property owned a number of lots along Canal Street'which was then called Duggan Street. He operated a tannery near Blackwell's foundry.</p>
